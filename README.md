# TFRecord Generator
## This project has been totally changed to a TFRecord generator

Still almost 100% code has been written by the project owner [Dat Tran]. Dataset files and some other unnecessary files have been cleaned up in order to organize the project structure.

Now, this project is used for generating TFRecord files for object detection.
